# 3Dstlproteins_phdthesis

Prepared the stl files from my Ph.D.

Two next steps:
1.  Buy a 3D printer and learn how to 3D print stl files.
2.  Put stl files into VR and NFT space.

I am a biochemist who is looking to make a transition from academia into industry. Part of this effort is establish the appropriate business plan to map my skills to the market. One of the main ways that I seek to engage my potential clients is through digital arts. Websites, educational content, technical writing, etc. Unfortunately, I feel like this transition is difficult because there is a large learning curve to all of this. I am entirely new to digital work, though I would like the transition to entirely remote work in the digital sphere outside the laboratory. I have a skill in 3D protein structure modeling. This is my technical expertise. You can see my work digitally as 3D objects in the web browser here:

I would like to specifically hire you for getting both your writing assistance and marketing research skills on a specific pair of projects.
1. A COVID-19 vaccine and drug education website for VR, mobile, and desktop that markets my skills to the general public with an emphasis on extremely clear copywriting and blog posts.
2. A website about mental health for the same platforms specifically focusing on telling a story about my own personal healing journey.
I want to scale a newsletter from this initial post:

I looked at your online reviews and impressed by the extent of your skills and overall good set of reviews.

What do you need from me in terms of specifics to work together?

Do you have an online portfolio of previous projects that I can use to evaluate to a greater degree the prospect of working with you in a freelance relationship?

The three priorities I have in all of this are completeness, clarity, simplicity, and marketability. Because the aforementioned projects are very hot topics right now, I want the finished product to be pristine. Scaling a business that empowers us all.

Thank you for your help, and I hope you have a happy New Years.
